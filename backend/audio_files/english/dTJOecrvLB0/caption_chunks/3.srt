1
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:50,859
And these lessons do that.

2
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,459
They're all about showing.

3
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,219
It's just telling you the word like with off-use skate instead of just a definition they

4
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,539
give you, the oil companies try to obfuscate the benefits of wind energy.

5
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,179
Oh, that's so good.

6
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,180
Right.

7
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
Suddenly it clicks.

8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,180
You get it.

9
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,180
The power of the word.

10
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,180
It's not just a word anymore.

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,180
It's like a tool.

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,180
Exactly.

13
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Okay.

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,938
So diving into our deep dive then.

15
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:15,858
There's this pair that really stood out to me.
