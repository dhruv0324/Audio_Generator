1
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,099
And it's not just physical stuff either.

2
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:38,340
Like a process at work, you know?

3
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,340
Oh, for sure.

4
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,659
Like when you're stuck with those online forms.

5
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:42,659
Yeah.

6
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,180
And it's like they ask the same thing five different ways.

7
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,340
The worst.

8
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,620
That's cumbersome bureaucracy for you.

9
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,620
It is.

10
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,739
There's some could be like an idea too.

11
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:52,739
Right.

12
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:53,739
Absolutely.

13
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,980
Untangling a really dense philosophical argument that can feel pretty cumbersome.

14
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Totally.

15
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,980
It's funny though, right?

16
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,420
We think about words.
