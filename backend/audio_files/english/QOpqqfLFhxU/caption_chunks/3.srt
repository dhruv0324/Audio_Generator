1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're absolutely right. Having a true best friend is like winning the lottery.

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They're rare, but when you find one, you're incredibly lucky.

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Exactly.

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You know, Robin, I have a lot of friends, both offline and online,

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but when I'm feeling down, it's like nobody really gets it.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's as if I'm speaking a different language, and they're just nodding along without truly understanding.
