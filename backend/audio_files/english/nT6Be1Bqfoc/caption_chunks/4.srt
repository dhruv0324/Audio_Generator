1
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,760
So I would cut little shapes, I would draw images on the front of it, and then I decided to sell

2
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,319
these beautiful books that I had created.

3
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:38,358
So it'd be like a 20 page book or maybe even like 10 only, but I stapled it or I would tie it

4
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:44,040
with string and then kids at my school really wanted my books and so I started selling them for

5
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,680
like 10 cents each. 10 cents these days, I don't even think they exist.

6
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,599
I don't think anyone uses 10 cents anymore, but then with my 10 cents I could buy sweets,
