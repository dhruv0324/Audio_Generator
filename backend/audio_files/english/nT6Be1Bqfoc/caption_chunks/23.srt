1
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,360
Yeah.

2
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,158
What is a gummy?

3
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,438
Uh, gummy candy is a soft chewy.

4
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,120
It's made of gelatin, like, I would guess.

5
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,480
But the sour patch kids, so they're sour patch kids, because it's like sweet, sweet gummy,

6
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,919
and it's covered with like some, we were talking before about you called Schroober, right?

7
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,960
Like the citric acid or something, it's covered in something sour.

8
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,440
So it has that sweet and sour thing that like makes you like, pucker, pucker your lips, right?
