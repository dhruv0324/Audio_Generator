1
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,759
as they grow up, right?

2
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,240
Yeah.

3
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,960
Yeah.

4
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,360
You know, listening to hard rock music.

5
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,320
Oh, you know, you're listening to that.

6
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,840
You're grounded.

7
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,278
What does that mean?

8
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:17,399
If you tell your kid, you're grounded.

9
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,559
Yeah, when the kid is punished, that without no TV, no phone for, I don't know, a few weeks

10
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:24,120
or months, right?

11
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,759
Maybe we need to do another podcast episode on our stories of being grounded.

12
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,720
I don't know if that happened to you.

13
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,000
I was thinking, oh yeah, you too.

14
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,039
A couple of times when I was kid.

15
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:38,759
So coming back to the, to the story, users can be up for days.
