1
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,780
It does.

2
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,139
It's the difference between loving a band and like knowing every single bootleg recording

3
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,139
they've ever made.

4
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,139
Right.

5
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,139
But, you know, even the experts, sometimes they want to just sit back and experience something

6
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,379
through someone else's eyes.

7
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,379
Oh, 100%.

8
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:28,939
Like a good book or movie.

9
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,939
That's living vicariously, right?

10
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,939
It is.

11
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,819
And it's the best kind of escape, you know?

12
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,860
All the fun, none of the actual risk.

13
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,620
And it can really open your mind, too.

14
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,620
Totally.

15
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,300
You get empathy, you learn things.

16
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,540
Sometimes you even realize, hey, I'm into that now.
