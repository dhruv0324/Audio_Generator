1
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,379
Speaking of things we got to be careful with, though, can we talk about lay versus lie?

2
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,379
Ah, the grammar, grammar, and lens.

3
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,740
They get everyone at some point.

4
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,740
They really do.

5
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,540
The way they explained it, it's like, finally it makes sense.

6
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Right.

7
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,540
Lay needs an object.

8
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,540
Lie does exactly.

9
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,500
Sometimes you just need that little refresher.

10
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Absolutely.

11
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,980
And that's what's so great about interactive English.

12
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,379
It makes you want to learn, you know?

13
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,379
It does.

14
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:56,379
They don't just define a word.

15
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:57,379
They make you feel it.

16
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,100
They bring the nuance, the humor, all of it.

17
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,060
So to wrap this up, I'm curious.
