1
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,360
So what does it mean if you're up?

2
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,200
Does it like to be awake?

3
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,159
To be awake, yeah.

4
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:46,360
It's like a drug that I think like Cassar was saying they probably like are zombies,

5
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,879
because they're not, they're strung out.

6
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,159
They're not, they're not sleeping.

7
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,000
She was saying it's something about it being scary because it could, it looks like candy.

8
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,200
It looks like sour patch kids, right?

9
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,960
So it could lure younger users.

10
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
What does it mean if you lure someone?

11
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,879
You know, I love this word because I know I always think of the witch,
