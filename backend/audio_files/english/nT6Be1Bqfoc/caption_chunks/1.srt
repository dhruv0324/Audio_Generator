A fun story from my school years is that when I was about seven years old, my dad was a high school principal

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,800
and he always came home, he brought home lots and lots of re-boxes with reams of paper.

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
What's a ream paper?

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,039
A ream is the collective noun for paper, so lots of paper.

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,439
A ream I think consists of 500 pages if I'm not mistaken.
