1
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I agree with you.

2
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, overall, I think both village and city life have their own merits and demerets.

3
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's up to the person to decide what suits them best.

4
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Exactly.

5
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's all about personal preferences and priorities.

6
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But it's always good to have a balance between the two, if possible.

7
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, that's a good idea.

8
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's always good to experience both ways of life and appreciate the differences.
