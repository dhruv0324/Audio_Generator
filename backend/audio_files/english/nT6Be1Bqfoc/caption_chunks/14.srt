1
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,718
We do in Portuguese.

2
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:34,519
I would call it.

3
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,718
Let me see if I can translate that in English to English.

4
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:42,038
Maybe a walking salesman or a walking salesperson.

5
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:42,838
Like a hawker?

6
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,278
Yeah.

7
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:44,838
A hawker.

8
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,519
Yeah.

9
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,399
That's what you call it.

10
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,119
The hawker?

11
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,399
hawker.

12
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,319
They're hawking their glitz.

13
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,038
Yeah.

14
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:52,278
Yeah.

15
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,399
Yeah.

16
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,918
The Portuguese translation would be that you know, a walking salesman, something like that.
