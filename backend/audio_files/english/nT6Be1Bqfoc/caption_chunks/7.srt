00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:37,240
Ah, if I'm not mistaken, I think in the UK ice lolly is a popsicle.

2
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,038
Yes, popsicle.

3
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:38,840
Like it's frozen.

4
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,400
There we go.

5
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,799
Yes.

6
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Like a lolly is a sucker and an ice lolly is a popsicle.

7
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,960
Yes, it's a combination.

8
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,199
So it looks like it could be a sucker, like a sweet, but it's ice.

9
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,360
So it's an ice lolly.

10
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,639
But in this case, a sucker.

11
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,080
That's what we would call it, a sucker.
