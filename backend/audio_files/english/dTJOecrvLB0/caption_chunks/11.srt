1
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,780
quite there yet.

2
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,500
The almost, but not quite crew.

3
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
The dilatants.

4
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Ah, yes.

5
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,300
Enthusiastic for sure.

6
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
Fabulous of many things.

7
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,020
But maybe masters of none, at least not yet.

8
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,099
Which, hey, we've all been there, right?

9
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,099
Of course.

10
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,259
That the getting stage, it's exciting.

11
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,539
So much to explore.

12
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:14,780
But dilatant, it's a good reminder that, you know, real expertise that takes time.
