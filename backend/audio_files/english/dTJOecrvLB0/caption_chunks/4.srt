1
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,700
You pick what is and cumbersome.

2
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,938
Oh, interesting.

3
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:20,578
Because one's about things we see everywhere.

4
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:21,578
Yeah.

5
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:24,900
It's about things that are just like the opposite of graceful.

6
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Yeah.

7
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Like smartphones.

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,900
They're ubiquitous.

9
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,900
Right.

10
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,900
You see them everywhere.

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,340
But also, let's be honest, trying to walk and text and like hold a coffee, fimbusome.

12
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,340
The irony.
