1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Just thinking about friendships, you know?

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How some people come into our lives and become more than just friends.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, really? What got you thinking about that all of a sudden?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is there something bothering you?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Not exactly, Robin.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just that sometimes life throws situations at us.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And during those moments, we need someone who truly understands us.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Someone who gets us even better than we get ourselves.
