1
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,579
Yes.

2
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:24,579
Not just recognize them on a quiz.

3
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:25,579
Exactly.

4
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:33,100
About wielding language with, you know, confidence and even a little playfulness, I'd say.

5
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,098
Totally.

6
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:35,859
They crack the code on words we think we know.

7
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,460
But not really when it comes to using them well.

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,460
And that's what I love.

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,179
It's like they get the, it's not about sounding like a dictionary.

10
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,738
It's about, it's about choosing the perfect word.

11
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:46,738
Yes.

12
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:48,859
To get your meaning across perfectly.

13
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:49,859
Yeah.
