00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,718
He had different things every day, like and most of it was like sealed.

2
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,960
But a lot of it like we had like gumballs and he would take it with his hand and like hand it to you.

3
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,759
You get too gumball.

4
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,639
Hopefully he washed them first.

5
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,718
That's the problem.

6
00:03:59,718 --> 00:04:00,438
I'll never know.

7
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:01,800
We'll never have the answers.

9
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,039
with someone, you completely forget it.

10
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,439
Now I find that the best solution for this is for you to use the new word to learn as soon as possible
