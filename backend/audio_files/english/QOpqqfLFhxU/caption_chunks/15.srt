00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You may not learn much about your heritage and identity.

2
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You also have to deal with your problems and challenges by yourself.

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You may not get enough support or guidance from your family.

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Both have their own strengths and weaknesses. It depends on what suits you and your needs best.
