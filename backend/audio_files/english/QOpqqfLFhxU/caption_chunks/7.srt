00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So true. It's not about the number of years.

2
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's about the depth of understanding.

3
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's about knowing that even if you haven't spoken in weeks when you do,

4
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
it's like no time has passed at all.

5
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You know, Ronika, I consider you one of those rare finds.

6
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The kind of friend who gets it without me having to explain.

7
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And that's a treasure worth holding on to.

8
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Robin, you're my anchor too.

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Thanks for being there, even when I don't have the words to express what I'm feeling.
