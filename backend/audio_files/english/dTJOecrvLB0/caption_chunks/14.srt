1
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,180
Present focused.

2
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,100
Like that conversation where you hang on every word, no distractions, you're just there.

3
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,699
That's when connection happens, right?

4
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:12,699
When you're really present.

5
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:13,699
100%.

6
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:17,259
But then hastily, that has a different energy.

7
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,459
Fast, maybe a little rushed.

8
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,500
Sometimes necessary, but usually leads to mistakes.

9
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Exactly.

10
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Yeah.

11
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,699
Like that email you did proofread.

12
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,180
We're saying something without thinking.

13
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,300
Oh, we've all been there.

14
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,098
It's about balance, I think.

15
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:31,098
It is.

16
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,139
Knowing when to move fast when to slow down.
