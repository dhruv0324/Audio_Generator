You know, Ronika, I've had my fair share of friends too.

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Some have come and gone, but the true ones, the ones who stick around, they're like anchors.

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They keep you grounded even when life's storms rage.

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Absolutely.

5
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A true friend isn't just there for the good times.
