1
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
Right.

2
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,258
Like that kind of, oh, I'm sure you studied so hard for that.

3
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:26,258
Exactly.

4
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,500
You can hear the wink and the nudge in the word.

5
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,579
Total sarcasm, but done well.

6
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,218
It's all about delivery, for sure.

7
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,218
It is.

8
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:34,218
It is.

9
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:37,780
And speaking of things we do, arduous always kind of fascinates me.

10
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,180
Because it's difficult, right?

11
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,180
Yeah.

12
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,060
But we're drawn to difficult.

13
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
It's true.

14
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,658
It's like the harder something is, the more rewarding, at least in theory.
